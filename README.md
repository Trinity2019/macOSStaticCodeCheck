# macOSStaticCodeCheck
This sample code demonstrate how to check static code signing information using SecStaticCodeCheckValidity* API and observe it's impact on the CPU usage when it is used on a large bundle.

Note that the purpose of this sample is not to question Appleâ€™s implementation of SecStaticCodeCheckValidity* on the performance side. Instead, I want to demonstrate that code signing validation is naturally CPU intensive, especially when running against large bundles.  We should carefully evaluate its impact on CPU/resource consumption and carefully choose when to use it and when not to use it.
