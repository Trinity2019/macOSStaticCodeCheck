# macOSStaticCodeCheck
This sample code demonstrates how to check static code signing information using `SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors` API and then demonstrates it's impact on the CPU usage when it is used on a large bundle.

Note that the purpose of this sample is not to question Appleâ€™s implementation of `SecStaticCodeCheckValidity*` on the performance side. Instead, I want to demonstrate that code signing validation is CPU intensive.  We should carefully evaluate its impact on CPU/resource consumption and carefully choose when to use it and when not to use it.
